# Features
## Superb design
With clean and elegant interface, Xabber looks and works great. No other existing client can match it, Xabber user experience is second to none.
## Conversations up front
We studied many existing chat solutions, took the best from all of them, then came with some tricks of our own. Xabber is friendly, informative, yet subtle and concise.
## Multiple accounts
Just like Android version, Xabber for Web supports multiple accounts.
## Synchronized settings
Setting up a new device can be tedious. Not anymore. You can log into Xabber with one click, we'll sync your settings from the server and you'll be set in no time.
All your accounts and settings are synchronized instantly, you just need to enter passwords. We don't sync passwords because of safety reasons.
## Sending media
Send and receive audio,  images, voice messages and files, view and forward them!

## Support Xabber Development
The best among existing clients, Xabber is still far from being outstanding.  Still, there are things that are needed to make Xabber perfectly working, independent and secure client. But perfection is a very expensive thing which we hardly can afford in the present economic situation in Russia and in our small but proud company. 

Our goal is to create a beautiful unified user experience in federated XMPP environment on different platforms. Android version was released in 2011 and made its way to be number one XMPP client for Android.  And we are not about to stop! Improvements keep on coming constantly. iOS version is under development too. 

If like us, you share our goal and feel like being part of this project,  you have many options to help us make it happen.
